      <h1>Project Summary</h1>
      In this project, we aim to educate people on the rising prevelance of fossil fuel emission globally. Fossil fuel emission is a major cause of global warming, and it is crucial that we recognize and understand how we can fix this issue. We chose to focus on the top ten countries in terms of fossil fuel emission, as these countries are impacting our world the most. Furthermore, we chose to use data from 2014, as there was a massive increase in fossil fuel emission in this year.

  <h4>Our Takeaways:</h4>
  <p> - Countries with larger populations tended to be the ones with the largest fossil fuel emissions, however smaller countries such as Korea were less efficient as they are not in the top 10 for population, yet they are in the top 10 for fossil fuel emissions. </p>
  <p>  - The countries with the most fossil fuel emissions on the chart (the most red) had significantly more solid fuel emissions, suggesting that solid fuel is contributing the majority of fossil fuel emissions.</p>
  <p>  - This data spreads across the globe, and it is not just concentrated in one region or area. Combating fossil fuel emissions is therefore a global effort. While some countries may be doing better than others, it is still something that affects the whole world. </p>
